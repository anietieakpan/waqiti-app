Comprehensive 2FA/MFA Testing Strategy
1. Introduction
   This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation in the Waqiti peer-to-peer financial application. The MFA system spans two microservices:

User Service: Handles authentication logic, MFA configuration, and verification code management
Notification Service: Delivers verification codes through different channels (SMS, Email)

The testing strategy aims to verify the functionality, security, reliability, and performance of the MFA system through multiple testing approaches.
2. Test Environments

8. Conclusion
   This comprehensive testing strategy provides thorough coverage of the MFA implementation across both the User and Notification services. By implementing these tests, we can ensure that:

The MFA setup process works correctly for all methods (TOTP, SMS, Email)
The verification process is secure and reliable
The integration between services is robust
The system handles edge cases and failure scenarios gracefully
The user experience remains smooth and intuitive

Regular execution of these tests as part of the development and deployment processes will help maintain the quality and security of the MFA system over time.

Commands to Execute MFA Test Cases
Here are the commands you can use to execute the various test categories in your MFA implementation. These commands are based on Maven, which appears to be your build system based on the project structure.
1. Running Unit Tests
# Run all unit tests
mvn test

# Run a specific unit test class
mvn test -Dtest=MfaServiceTest

# Run a specific test method
mvn test -Dtest=MfaServiceTest#testSetupTotp

# Run tests with a specific tag
mvn test -Dgroups=UnitTest

2. Running Integration Tests
# Run all integration tests
mvn failsafe:integration-test

# Run a specific integration test class
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dtest=MfaControllerIntegrationTest

# Run integration tests with a specific tag
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dgroups=IntegrationTest

3. Running Specific Test Categories
# Run security tests
mvn test -Dgroups=SecurityTest

# Run performance tests
mvn test -Dgroups=PerformanceTest

# Run localization tests
mvn test -Dgroups=LocalizationTest

4. Running All Tests
# Run all tests (unit tests and integration tests)
mvn verify

5. Running Cross-Service Tests
   You'll need to execute these from the parent project directory:
# Run tests that span both user-service and notification-service
mvn verify -pl user-service,notification-service

6. Running Tests with Specific Environment Variables
# Run tests with specific properties
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=test -Dtwilio.enabled=false

7. Using the Custom Testing Script
   The run-tests.sh script in your notification service provides a convenient way to run different types of tests:
# Run unit tests
./run-tests.sh unit

# Run integration tests
./run-tests.sh integration

# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh all

# Run a specific test class
./run-tests.sh specific MfaServiceTest

8. Running Tests from IDEs
   For IDE-based testing:

IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click on the test class or method and select "Run" or "Debug"
Eclipse: Right-click on the test class or method and select "Run As" > "JUnit Test"
VS Code: Use the Testing sidebar to run individual tests or test classes

9. Running Automated Test Suites in CI/CD
   In your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI), you might use:
# Example GitHub Actions workflow step
- name: Run MFA Unit Tests
  run: mvn test -Dgroups=UnitTest

- name: Run MFA Integration Tests
  run: mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dgroups=IntegrationTest

10. Additional Commands for Test Reports and Coverage
# Generate test reports
mvn surefire-report:report

# Generate test coverage report with JaCoCo
mvn test jacoco:report

# Check test coverage thresholds
mvn verify -Pjacoco

Make sure Docker is running before executing integration tests that use Testcontainers, as these tests will spin up containerized dependencies like PostgreSQL and Kafka.
